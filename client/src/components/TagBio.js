                I've been in the aquatics industry for the last five years. I started on the front lines as a lifeguard, swim instructor and front desk rep. During my time at Team Sheeper Inc. I moved up and filled a number of roles that have all taught me about life. The most important lessons remind me of the value found in community, responsibility and enjoing the work that you do. I recently stepped down from my position as head lifeguard for Rinconada Pool so I can focus on the next chapter of my career and life.
